Overview

    The Egyptian League Dashboard API is a RESTful service built using Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and MySQL.
    It is designed to replace paper-based management of teams and players in the Egyptian League by providing a modern digital dashboard.
    
    Through this API, admins can:
    
    Manage teams (view, update shirt color, etc.)
    
    Manage players (add, update salary, transfer, retire, delete)
    
    Search for players by name
    
    View players of a specific team
